This happens because the elementary particles that atoms are made of are able to travel slower than the speed of light, the largest speed possible. The speed at which a particle can travel is determined by its mass. Particles with zero mass always travel at the speed of light.

Two types of particles travelling through space, represented by the two people, feel a “friction” from this field, are slowed down from the speed of light, and thus acquire different masses.

Several theories have appeared that extend the current theory, and in addition to the already known particles, predict the existence of dark matter particles. Interestingly, these theories also predict the existence of five Higgs bosons, including the one predicted by the current theory. Precise measurement of the properties of the newly discovered particle, as well as searching for unknown dark matter particles, is therefore key to searching for experimental hints about the new theories. There are hopes that these measurements and discoveries will be made during the data-taking starting once again at CERN.

This will guide theorists aspiring to find a more advanced theory of elementary particles. It also makes the author of this article dream about manipulating space with the help of Higgs bosons. The writers of the science-fiction series Star Trek claimed that although their spaceships travel to distant stars, they did not break the law that nothing is faster than the speed of light. Instead, space is manipulated around the spaceship in such a way that the ship – relative to space – is always going slower than light. Could Higgs bosons help to manipulate space? For now, one can only dream.\", \"paragraph4\": \"In the meantime, driven by curiosity, particle physicists continue to study the fundamental ingredients of matter, including the newly discovered Higgs boson.
